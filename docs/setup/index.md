# Set-Up

This section of the documentation is dedicated to how to install one of Hash's Face Tracking Add-ons without any prior knowledge of VRChat avatar creation

## Download The add-on From Booth/Ko-fi

Click the download button and unzip the archive if you bought the add-on off of Booth

## Download the appropriate version of the avatar

Please look at the store listing of the add-on and there should be a version of the avatar with which the add-on is compatible with.

Download that off of Booth as well.

If the specific avatar package version is not available anymore please contact me trough Booth DMs By clicking the mail icon on [my Booth page](https://hashedits.booth.pm/)
